### GitSearch
### Task 
    ## Please create an Angular app that does the following:
        - The application should have 2 lazy loaded routes: /repos and /commits
        - In /repos, provide a table that allows you to search for repositories on Github using their API
        - by name, optionally filtered by language and minimum number of stars
        - by text contained in the title of an (open/closed) issue (e.g. you search for "octopress" and you get all the repositories that have issues containing that term)
    ## Visualize the rows:
        - name of the repo
        - avatar of the owner
        - repo creation date
        - When clicking the table row, the /commits page should open for corresponding repo
        - In /commits, provide a table that allows you to search for commits of selected repository using Github API
    ## Visualize the rows:
        - commit author
        - url
        - commit message
